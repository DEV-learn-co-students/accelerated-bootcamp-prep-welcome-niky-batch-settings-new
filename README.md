# Welcome to to Accelerated Bootcamp Prep

Hi! Welcome to the innaugural class of Accelerated Bootcamp Prep with me, Avi Flombaum, co-founder, Chief Product Officer, and Dean of Flatiron School.

I'm so excited to be teaching and learning with you all, it's actually been a bit since I've run a class at Flatiron School. I wanted to take sometime to tell you a few things:

1. What We're Going to Learn
2. How this Course is Going to Work
3. Expectations About Our Community

Let's jump right in.

## What We're Going to Learn

Rather than try to cover everything that's in our Bootcamp Prep in the time we have together, I thought it'd be nice to focus on an introduction to fullstack web development with Javascript. To make things as interesting, as we learn we're going to be working on small components of a web application called Icebreaker that I'll introduce in the next lesson. By the end of the course, you'll have built all the parts needed to put that application together and have a working copy of Icebreaker.

The order of the material will be:

### HTML

We're going to learn the basics of HTML, a good amount of tags and attributes.

### CSS

We're going to cover the most important CSS selectors and some base styles and layouts.

### Bootstrap Framework

We're not really going to dive deep into bootstrap but we'll be using it later in the course so a light introduction.

### Javascript

The language is pretty big, we're going to focus on the main mechanics of the lanugage and move on.

### Object Oriented Javascript

We're going to cover Prototypes and classical Object Orientation as we build "Models" for our data.

### SQL

We're going to cover the most basic SQL statements needed for CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete). This section is going to move very fast because SQL is a giant and important topic and the truth is, you need very little of it to get where we're going.

### Object-Relational-Mappers

We're going to put together what we learned about classical Object Orientation in Javascript and SQL to build our own small ORM (Object-Relational-Mapper), which is a type of code that interacts with Databases.

### Node, HTTP, Express, M-V-C

The last section will focus on putting everything together to create a fullstack Javascript web application using Node and Express in the Model-View-Controller pattern.

It's a lot and I'm sure there's a lot described above that makes no sense or means nothing to you right now, but by the end, it'll feel quite familiar.

## How this Course is Going to Work


### Schedule

We're experimenting with this format but here's the plan.

* Orientation: Sunday, Novemeber 5th, 12-2pm EST
* Week 1: Monday November 6th - Friday November 10th
* Lecture 1: Saturday, November 11th, 12-4pm EST
* Lecture 2: Sunday, November 12th, 12-4pm EST
* Week 2: Monday November 13th - Friday November 17th
* Lecture 3: Saturday, November 18th, 12-4pm EST
* Lecture 4: Sunday, November 19th, 12-4pm EST

Orientation is going to cover a lot of the basics of learning how to code, how to use Learn.co and the tools required to be a real developer like GitHub, a text editor, a terminal, test-driven-development, and etc. The goal of orientation is to make sure that you're all ready to get started with your Week 1 material. I'll be sticking around for a few hours after orientation to answer questions and help out on Slack. We should be getting some help from some instructors and Flatiron people too.

During the week, you're expected to move through the curriculum in the week's topic on Learn.co on your own. It's going to be work - set aside time to do it. Clear you calendar. Tell your friends and family in advance that you're busy. Wake up early. Don't watch TV. Stop checking Reddit and Twitter. Focus. It'll change your life if you do. In every week's curriculum, there are supplemental sections. You can use those in 3 ways, if you're stuck, maybe see if something there might help, if you're finished, do more work, after the course, learn more.

There's also a very good chance that I'll be hosting some Study Groups on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the week, probably around 6-8pm EST. That'll be a time to ask questions and checkin with eachother.

If you don't do the week's curriculum, the weekend lectures are going to be a bit hard to follow, so again, I highly recommend you make a calendar and explicitly schedule your learning time in advance, it helps a lot.

The weekend lectures are going to be super fun. The way they are going to work is in short 20-40 minute intervals where I will introduce a topic, and then you all will break off to work on a lab on that topic together for a bit, then we'll get back together, review the concepts in the lab, and then push forward with another 20-40 minute lecture on a new topic. All the lectures will be recorded so you'll be able to watch them again. We're going to cover a TON of ground on the weekends, so get a good night's sleep Friday.

That's basically the plan. You'll always have access to this curriculum so even if you can't finish everything in the time we have together, you'll still be able to do it on your own and with the Flatiron School community.

### Learn.co and Learning with Flatiron School

Learn.co is the educational platform we built at Flatiron School to power all of our classes. It's a bit different than other online learning systems, as you might be able to tell already. Here's the big stuff you need to know right now.

1. We write. A lot. Programming is reading and writing all day and if you're serious about this career you might as well get used to reading about code a ton. We also think that videos are just too easy to not pay attention too when you're watching. Code is all details and syntax and videos make it hard to grasp those. I'll be adding some video lectures to the course but expect to see a lot of READMEs. Read. Read all of it. Seriously, it's how you learn.

2. We use real tools. There are no REPLs here or contrived programming environments that over-simplify things. You're going to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) we built called the [Learn IDE](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide). It comes with a terminal that provides you with a programming environment so you don't have to worry about setting up a proper environment.

3. Community is everything to us. Learn is social. You'll see people asking questions, we encourage you to ask questions (it's how you learn), we expect you to help others when you can (and you should always try, 2 brains trying to figure something out is always better than 1). You can self organize study groups to meet other students and work together. And we want you to be a part of our [Slack community](http://slack.learn.co) to hang out and [discuss the course](https://learn-co.slack.com/messages/C7UAXNLEB) and life and everything.

We're going to do our best to staff the "Ask a Question" feature on Learn with teachers so that you get answers faster but we can't promise anything. I'll also be around a bunch during the week so don't be shocked if I pop-in to answer your question and help. I really do love meeting students and teaching.

Finally, all of our lectures (except for orientation) are going to be hosted via [Zoom](https://zoom.us) so I recommend downloading the client in advance.

## Expectations About Our Community

Finally, really quick, I want to say that our community is very important to us. Flatiron School is a supportive, open, and friendly place. We have a 0 tolerance to any sort of meanness, racism, sexism, harrassment, abuse, and such. You can read our full [Code of Conduct](http://flatironschool.com/code-of-conduct/) and we take it really seriously. Let's avoid discussing topics that are controversial and focus instead on code and how much we love learning. So please keep this place amazing. Should anything come up, please reach out to [support@flatironschool.com](mailto:support@flatironschool.com) or DM me on Slack or email me directly [avi@flatironschool.com](mailto:avi@flatironschool.com).

## Closing Thoughts

That's about it - let's get started learning!
